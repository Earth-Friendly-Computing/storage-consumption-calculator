Simple Storage Consumption Calculator
------------

This is a small script for calculating the amount of energy used while storing a specific amount of data.

To run, open the file in RStudio and click "run app" in the upper-right hand corner.

Estimates for disk energy utilization are drawn from: https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology/#storage

## Wish list
- [ ] Add tape to the disk type radio list
- [ ] Add a slider to select among drive densities and wattages
- [ ] Add a slider for disk utilization (disks are rarely, if ever, 100% filled)
- [ ] implement logic for NAS, data center, and hyperscale storage utilization multipliers
